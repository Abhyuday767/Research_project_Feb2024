# Cancer Recurrence Prediction using Feature-Based Machine Learning from Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma CT Images

This repository contains predictive models for cancer recurrence based on feature-based machine learning techniques applied to Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) CT images.

## Predictions

### 1. Survival Prediction
- **Parameters**: Age, Diagnosis, Grade, Stage
- **Description**: Predicts whether survival is possible or not based on the provided parameters.

### 2. Age Group Analysis for Recurrence
- **Parameters**: Age, Stage
- **Description**: Determines which age group is more susceptible to recurrence based on age and stage.

### 3. Chemotherapy Regimen Recommendation
- **Parameters**: Stage, Sex, Diagnosis
- **Description**: Recommends whether chemotherapy regimen is required based on stage, sex, and diagnosis.

### 4. Prescribed Dose Determination
- **Parameters**: Age, RT Total Dose (Gy), Dose/Fraction (Gy/fx)
- **Description**: Calculates the prescribed dose for different age groups based on radiation therapy parameters.
